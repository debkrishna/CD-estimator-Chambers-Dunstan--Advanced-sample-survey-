# CD-estimator-Chambers-Dunstan--Advanced-sample-survey-
This is a simple method of estimating Finite population Distribution function. 
The method assumes a model based approach to survey estimation and uses auxiliary population information directly to the estimation process.
I have also used Simulation process to compare this CD estimator with Na√Øve design based Estimator with respect to Relative Bias and Relative Mean Square Error(MSE).
